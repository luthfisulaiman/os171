Hello, this is explanation about linux booting!

There are 6 stages of Linux Boot Process:
1. Boot (Basic I/O System Executes MBR)
2. MBR (Master Boot Record executes GRUB)
3. GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader executes Kernel)
4. Kernel (Executes /sbin/init)
5. Init (Executes runlevel programs)
6. Runlevel (executed from /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/
